## Intro Of The Project
This project has been made by myself from the machine learning course in the university of Padua.

In this notebook we are going to explore the use of unsupervised clustering methods.

We are going to touch: 
1. 1D dataset and 2D dataset with EM and Kmeans algorithm
2. MNIST clustering applying GMM 
3. Comparison with supervised models: Kmeans and GMM vs NNS on MNIST

<!-- Get started -->
## Get Started

For start:
1. Download and install python kernel
2. Download and install anaconda with jupyter notebook or vsc with jupyter extension or google colab
3. Install the libraries: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn
